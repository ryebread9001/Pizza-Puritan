## Overview

This project is a unity built, 2d platformer centered around the idea that pizza needs to be free of pineapple.
The purpose of the game is to collect 12 pizza slices without touching any pineapple. Use arrow keys to move (jump, left, right, fall).

My intent writing this was to learn more about creating game logic efficiently and more importantly to create a fun game.

## Development Environment

I used Unity2D to create this game. I also used a pixel art import to create assets.

This was built entirely in c#.

## Future Work

Things to do:
* Add Start Menu
* Redo placeholder pixel art
* Potentially change camera movement to a fluid follow camera
* Create death logic for pizza placement
* Win Screen
